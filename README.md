# Backbone.js Tutorial Project

A comprehensive tutorial project demonstrating the core concepts and features of Backbone.js, a lightweight JavaScript library that provides structure to web applications through models, views, collections, and routers.

## Overview

This project serves as a learning resource for Backbone.js, showcasing various components and patterns through practical examples. Each JavaScript file in this repository demonstrates different aspects of Backbone.js, making it easier to understand how to build structured front-end applications.

## Features

This tutorial project covers the following Backbone.js concepts:

### Models
- Basic model creation and initialization
- Model attributes and methods
- Model validation
- Model inheritance
- Data operations (get, set, save, etc.)

### Views
- View rendering and initialization
- Template integration with Underscore.js
- Event handling in views
- DOM manipulation

### Collections
- Creating and managing collections of models
- Collection operations (add, remove, sort, filter, etc.)
- Collection events

### Routers
- Basic routing
- Parameterized routing
- Advanced routing with event handling
- Programmatic navigation

### Events
- Custom event handling
- Event binding and triggering
- Event propagation

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/backbone-tutorial.git
   ```

2. Open the project folder:
   ```
   cd backbone-tutorial
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your browser to see the examples in action.

## Usage Examples

### Models

```javascript
// Creating a model
var Tutorial = Backbone.Model.extend({
  initialize: function() {
    console.log("Tutorial model initialized");
  }
});

// Instantiating a model
var backbone = new Tutorial();
```

### Views

```javascript
// Creating a view with a template
var firstView = Backbone.View.extend({
  el: "#container",
  template: _.template($("#template").html()),
  
  initialize: function() {
    this.render();
  },
  
  render: function() {
    this.$el.html(this.template());
  }
});

// Instantiating a view
var view = new firstView();
```

### Routers

```javascript
// Creating a router with routes
var router = Backbone.Router.extend({
  routes: {
    "firstOrder": "pizzaOrder",
    "secondOrder": "burgerOrder",
    "thirdOrder": "momosOrder",
    "*default": "default"
  },
  
  pizzaOrder: function() {
    var pizzaView = new pizza({ el: "#container" });
    pizzaView.render();
  },
  
  // Other route handlers...
});

// Starting the router
var routerInstance = new router();
Backbone.history.start();
```
